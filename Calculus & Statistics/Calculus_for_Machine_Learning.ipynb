        "\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is fundamentally about learning patterns from data and optimizing models to make accurate predictions. Calculus provides the mathematical tools needed to achieve these goals. Here’s why calculus is essential in ML:\n",

        "\n",
        "Most ML models (like linear regression, neural networks, and SVMs) learn by minimizing a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy).\n",
        "\n",
        "Derivatives tell us how the loss changes as we tweak model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Descent (and variants like SGD, Adam) use calculus to iteratively adjust weights and minimize loss.\n",

        "Neural networks (NNs) have millions of parameters. To train them:\n",
        "\n",
        "We use partial derivatives (calculus) to compute how each weight affects the final loss.\n",

        "The chain rule allows us to propagate errors backward (backpropagation) and update weights efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "Most ML models have multiple inputs and parameters (e.g., a neural net with weights w1,w1,...,wn).\n",
        "\n",
        "Partial derivatives tell us how changing one parameter affects the output while keeping others fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gradient (∇L) is a vector of all partial derivatives, pointing in the direction of steepest ascent.\n",

        "Bayesian ML uses integrals to compute probabilities (e.g., marginalization).\n",
