## 📁 Contents

### 1. `Python_fundamentals.ipynb`

This notebook introduces the core basics of Python:

- Variables, Data Types (int, float, str, bool)
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and lambda expressions
- Basic I/O and error handling

🎯 **Goal:** Build a solid base in Python syntax and logic for any programming or data science task.

### 2. `Numpy_functions_uses.ipynb`

This notebook is focused on practical uses of NumPy, the essential library for numerical computing:

- Creating arrays (`np.array`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`)
- Array operations (indexing, slicing, reshaping)
- Mathematical functions (`np.mean`, `np.std`, `np.sum`)
- Broadcasting and vectorized operations
- Linear algebra with NumPy (`np.dot`, `np.linalg`)
- Utility functions (`np.argmax`, `np.argmin`, `np.histogram`, `np.percentile`, etc.)

🎯 **Goal:** Learn how to use NumPy efficiently for numerical tasks and prepare for machine learning workflows.
